## 🎯 Common Objections & Responses

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:** "I understand budget is important. Let's look at the ROI. This system will save you [X hours/week] in manual work. At your HR team's salary, that's [Y amount] per month. The system pays for itself in [Z months]. Plus, you avoid compliance fines which can be [amount] per violation."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** "Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help with your evaluation, what specific concerns should I address? Is it budget, timeline, features, or something else? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."

### "We're already using [competitor]"
**Response:** "Great! Then you understand the value of an HR system. What's working well with [competitor]? What would you like to improve? [Then show how your system addresses those gaps, especially UAE features]"

### "It's not 100% complete"
**Response:** "That's actually an advantage. You're getting 75% of a $150K system for $25K-$45K. The remaining work is customization and polish, which you'd need anyway to match your workflows. Plus, you can launch in 4-6 weeks instead of 6-9 months."

### "We need to see references"
**Response:** "I understand. While this is a new product, the technology stack is proven (React, TypeScript, CodeIgniter). I can connect you with [agencies/developers] who've reviewed the code. Would a technical review by your team help?"

### "Can we try it first?"
**Response:** "I can give you demo access for [X days] so your team can explore. However, since this is source code, not SaaS, the full value comes from customization and deployment. How about we do a pilot implementation for one department?"
